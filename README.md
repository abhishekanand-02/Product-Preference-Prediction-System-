## 📖 Overview
This project aims to develop a system that predicts whether a user will like a product based on its features and reviews. The goal is to enhance personalized recommendations and increase sales for e-commerce platforms.

## ❓ Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms face challenges in helping users navigate millions of products to find items they like. Current systems lack the ability to predict user preferences based on product features and reviews, which limits personalized recommendations and sales growth.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to build a **binary classification model** that predicts whether a user will like a product (1) or not (0). The model will leverage features such as:
- 🏷️ Product price  
- ⭐ Ratings  
- 📂 Category  
- 💸 Discount percentage  
- 📝 User review sentiment  

This system aims to improve personalized recommendations and drive sales by better understanding user preferences.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:
- **data**: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- **models**: Holds trained models and model definitions.
- **scripts**: Includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and prototyping.
- **logs**: Stores logs from model training and system execution.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Run `./init_setup.py` to create the necessary directories and files.  
3. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
